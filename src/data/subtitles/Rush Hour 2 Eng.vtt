00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Greetings from Martin's Movies.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.800
RUSH HOUR 2

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.600
Thank you.

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:25.867
Someone better call the police.

00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:36.669
I wish they all could be
California girls.

00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.300
- The Beach Boys are dope.
- I love Beach Boys.

00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:47.637
Hey, ladies, how you doin'?
Wait a minute.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.353
Where you goin'?
Let's get some sushi!

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.231
Hey! Hey, cutie!

00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:02.859
I wish they all could...

00:03:02.985 --> 00:03:05.820
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
That was my CD!

00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:08.615
Don't you ever touch
a Chinese man's CD.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.409
You see the way those girls drove off?
They was laughing at us.

00:03:11.534 --> 00:03:13.202
Those girls drove off
because of you.

00:03:13.327 --> 00:03:16.204
All I did was invite them
to have a drink.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.456
You invited them to get naked...

00:03:18.582 --> 00:03:20.875
and sacrifice a small goat.

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.378
Which word was "goat"?

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.005
You owe me a copy of
The Beach Boys' Greatest Hits.

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:29.967
Don't get no attitude with me, Lee.
I've worked your cases for three days.

00:03:30.134 --> 00:03:33.803
Reason I'm here in Hong Kong is 'cause
you said you'd show me a good time.

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:36.640
I'm on vacation, man,
and I want some mu sh...

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:39.851
- Mu shu? You hungry?
- No, Lee, not mu sh...

00:03:40.018 --> 00:03:42.853
Some mu shu.
I wanna see some women, man.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.188
Now stop playin' dumb
and show me to the sh...

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:51.611
There was a bombing at the
U.S. Embassy.

00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:54.614
Two American translators
were killed.

00:03:55.281 --> 00:03:56.198
Any leads?

00:03:58.034 --> 00:03:59.285
We think it's Ricky Tan.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.037
His entire gang of Triads
is at the club tonight.

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:07.584
If you don't want to take
the case, I'll understand.

00:04:08.543 --> 00:04:09.418
No, it's okay.

00:04:14.173 --> 00:04:15.465
What was that?

00:04:15.591 --> 00:04:18.927
Did you just take another
damn case on my vacation, man?

00:04:19.052 --> 00:04:22.513
Of course not. My superintendent
invited us to a club.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.850
- Big party tonight.
- Don't be messin' with me, Lee.

00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:28.727
I will slap you so hard,
you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:31.522
I mean it. I'll bitch-slap you
back to Bangkok.

00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:34.190
- Big party?
- Big one.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.735
Okay, well,
let's go party then.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:44.157
Hey, this is nice.
Hey, cutie.

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:46.910
They don't like tourists in here,
so try to blend in.

00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:50.329
What do you mean, blend in?
I'm two feet taller than everybody here.

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:55.960
- Wait here.
- Where you goin'?

00:04:56.085 --> 00:04:59.671
- Bathroom.
- Hurry back, 'cause we gonna party.

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.435
How you doin'?

00:05:15.561 --> 00:05:19.189
Come here a lot?
It's a nice place.

00:05:19.314 --> 00:05:22.692
Take us through the hours

00:05:22.817 --> 00:05:24.193
I won't make you, baby.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.988
What in the world
is goin' on up in here?

00:05:28.114 --> 00:05:30.783
Am I the only one
listenin' to this?

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:32.868
The man destroyin' a classic!

00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:35.953
With the force, don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough.

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:38.372
Keep on with the force
Don't stop.

00:05:38.498 --> 00:05:41.917
- Don't stop till you get enough.
- Boo!

00:05:42.043 --> 00:05:46.004
With the force, don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.757
I can't take
no more of this, man.

00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:18.199
Get closer Oh, get closer

00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:20.577
I'm burnin' now.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.497
Just love me.

00:06:25.623 --> 00:06:27.541
Till you.

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:30.753
Don't know how.

00:06:30.878 --> 00:06:33.421
Keep on till
the force starts up.

00:06:33.588 --> 00:06:35.506
Don't stop till you get enough
Keep on.

00:06:35.632 --> 00:06:39.135
Till the force starts up
Ah, don't stop till you get enough.

00:06:39.302 --> 00:06:41.220
Keep on
till the force starts up.

00:06:41.345 --> 00:06:43.388
Come on, girls!

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:45.807
Come on
till the force starts up.

00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:48.226
Ah, don't stop
till you get enough.

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:55.316
Come on! Come on!

00:06:56.692 --> 00:07:00.111
Come here, girls
Don't stop till you...

00:07:00.237 --> 00:07:02.780
Come on, girls
I can't believe it.

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:10.245
Come on, don't stop.
You know you feel the force!

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:13.874
Don't stop till you get enough.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.335
- I feel the force!
- Carter!

00:07:17.502 --> 00:07:19.545
Come on! Come on!

00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:21.506
- Carter!
- Come on, Lee!

00:07:21.673 --> 00:07:23.299
- Carter!
- Come on!

00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:30.973
I'll be right back
I'll be right back

00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:33.016
I'll be right back

00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:35.518
Lee, these people love me.
Come on out here.

00:07:35.644 --> 00:07:37.687
- Get off the stage.
- Are you crazy, man?

00:07:37.812 --> 00:07:40.689
I'm a star, a god to these people.
Check this out.

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:44.067
This is a gangster bar.
We are here undercover.

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:49.030
I knew you was lyin'.
I knew you was lyin', man.

00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:51.199
- I'm sorry, Carter.
- You a liar!

00:07:51.324 --> 00:07:54.326
We are here to find Ricky Tan.
We must tread softly.

00:07:54.452 --> 00:07:57.538
Tread softly?
What in the world you talkin' about?

00:07:57.663 --> 00:08:00.290
Who taught you how to roust a bar?
"Tread softly."

00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:04.044
These men are Triads,
the most deadly gang in China.

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:06.754
You think that scare me? I'm from
Los Angeles. We invented gangs.

00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:09.965
- Give me that badge.
- No! You are civilian!

00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:12.092
In Hong Kong, I am Michael Jackson!
You are Toto!

00:08:12.218 --> 00:08:15.178
You mean Tito! Toto is what
we ate last night for dinner.

00:08:15.304 --> 00:08:17.180
- Now give me that badge.
- No!

00:08:22.644 --> 00:08:24.020
Listen up!

00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:34.070
Right now!

00:08:43.537 --> 00:08:44.954
What did I just say?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.916
You just asked everybody
to pick up their samurai swords...

00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:51.419
and shave your butt.

00:08:51.544 --> 00:08:53.796
- I said that?
- Yes.

00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:58.383
Come out here and translate
this for me. Come on.

00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:00.385
All right, listen up!

00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:03.263
All the Triads
and the ugly women on this side...

00:09:03.388 --> 00:09:06.515
and all the fine women
on this side right now!

00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:08.017
Translate it.

00:09:08.434 --> 00:09:11.603
He wants the men on the right.
And the women on the left.

00:09:14.606 --> 00:09:16.941
Y'all gonna act like
y'all don't hear what I'm sayin'.

00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:20.236
Who in here know Ricky Tan?
Raise your hand.

00:09:21.237 --> 00:09:22.654
Translate.

00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:26.617
I apologize. My friend is very drunk.

00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:33.832
I see what's goin' on here. Okay.

00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:36.917
I ain't got time
to be playin' no games now.

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:38.836
Hu Li!

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.213
Hey, Lee!

00:09:54.183 --> 00:09:56.393
Out of the way!
L.A.P. D!

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.420
Lee! Hold up!

00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:34.343
Hell no.

00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:39.098
Lee, I'm takin' the stairs!

00:11:27.808 --> 00:11:28.808
Move aside, Kobe.

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:29.934
Sorry.

00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:48.576
Sorry for interrupting your meal, sir.

00:12:24.192 --> 00:12:25.151
Carter!

00:12:27.152 --> 00:12:28.820
Over here!

00:12:29.947 --> 00:12:31.615
- Lee!
- Help me!

00:12:33.033 --> 00:12:35.702
- How you get down there?
- Hurry up!

00:12:35.827 --> 00:12:38.954
Hold on!
Don't let go, man.

00:12:40.498 --> 00:12:42.207
- Here.
- Watch out behind you!

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:45.043
- Behind you!
- What?

00:12:51.216 --> 00:12:52.884
Who the hell was that?

00:12:55.136 --> 00:12:57.346
Lord Jesus, I don't wanna die!

00:12:57.471 --> 00:12:59.639
Lee, help me, man!

00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:03.309
Don't worry.
Chinese bamboo is very strong.

00:13:06.187 --> 00:13:08.063
- You sure, man?
- I'm sure.

00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:25.037
Let go! Let go!

00:13:25.162 --> 00:13:28.665
I can't believe I flew
10,000 miles for this shit!

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.803
I can't believe
you lied to me, man.

00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:46.306
- I'm sorry.
- You sorry?

00:13:46.431 --> 00:13:50.601
I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck up
my ass, and all you say is you sorry?

00:13:51.561 --> 00:13:53.854
- There was an explosion.
- I don't give a damn!

00:13:54.021 --> 00:13:57.273
At the American embassy.
Two Americans were killed.

00:13:58.776 --> 00:14:01.236
So you think this guy Ricky Tan
blew up the embassy?

00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:04.613
- I don't know.
- Then why the hell you lookin' for him?

00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:07.616
- We're gonna find out.
- No, you gonna find out.

00:14:07.742 --> 00:14:10.911
There's two billion Chinese people here.
Let one of them be your partner.

00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:17.751
Where the hell we at now?

00:14:17.918 --> 00:14:20.837
Massage parlor.
Heaven on Earth.

00:14:20.962 --> 00:14:22.421
This is more like it.

00:14:22.547 --> 00:14:26.342
I'm about to go in here and get
a massage and a hot tea bath right now.

00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:29.469
Just follow my lead.
Act like a tourist.

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:31.470
I am a tourist, fool.

00:14:34.099 --> 00:14:37.018
Slow down, Chen!
Hell is wrong with you?

00:14:47.444 --> 00:14:50.655
My American friend is on vacation.
I want to show him a good time.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.489
Oh, you American.

00:14:52.615 --> 00:14:55.200
- Yeah.
- You bring American money?

00:14:56.577 --> 00:14:58.453
- I got it, Lee.
- You sure?

00:14:58.579 --> 00:15:00.372
I'm sure.

00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:01.664
Thank you.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.750
- You're welcome.
- Right this way.

00:15:13.634 --> 00:15:15.010
Are you ready?

00:15:15.135 --> 00:15:18.221
You ready? I'm ready.

00:15:22.266 --> 00:15:25.268
Oh, my goodness!

00:15:25.394 --> 00:15:28.354
This place is off the hook!
I love Hong Kong.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.690
You get massage
from Chinese girl before?

00:15:30.816 --> 00:15:33.026
No, but I heard
it was the bomb.

00:15:33.151 --> 00:15:35.194
Come with me.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.697
You pick any girl
for you and your friend.

00:15:37.822 --> 00:15:39.740
- Any girl?
- Any girl.

00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:45.953
I don't know where to start.

00:15:47.747 --> 00:15:51.625
- I'll take that one. She got to come.
- Yes, she's very nice.

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:55.504
She is nice, but I hurt my back and my
neck, and I need a little more massage.

00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:57.839
So I'm gonna take her
in the pink too.

00:15:57.965 --> 00:16:00.383
- Oh, yes.
- And let me get her.

00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:03.136
And let me have her.
Can I get her too?

00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:05.346
And her right there.
She good with feet?

00:16:05.471 --> 00:16:07.597
- Oh, yes.
- What are you doing?

00:16:07.723 --> 00:16:11.601
- She said I could have any girl I want.
- Well, hurry up!

00:16:11.727 --> 00:16:15.271
What's wrong with you? Don't jump in
front of a black man in a buffet line.

00:16:15.397 --> 00:16:16.773
Calm down!

00:16:16.898 --> 00:16:19.608
Your friend has big appetite.

00:16:19.734 --> 00:16:24.196
Please, follow her upstairs
into the quiet room.

00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:26.656
It ain't gonna be
no quiet room no more.

00:16:32.704 --> 00:16:34.705
Y'all don't know
how good this feels.

00:16:34.831 --> 00:16:37.249
I got in a big fight last night
with the Triads.

00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:40.044
Y'all ever heard of the Triads?
I beat down like 20 of 'em.

00:16:40.169 --> 00:16:42.212
Y'all should've seen me.
It was on.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.634
This is what I'm talkin' about, man.
Now I'm on vacation.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.096
I knew you'd come through.
I just knew it.

00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:53.764
America?

00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:58.059
Wanna come to America with me?
Ever been to America?

00:16:58.185 --> 00:16:59.561
How's your girl?

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:03.230
- Lee, what's wrong?
- That's Ricky Tan.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.692
That's Ricky Tan?
That's a midget in a bathrobe!

00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:08.819
I will call for backup.

00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:11.029
He's four feet tall.
Let's bust him now.

00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:15.616
- He's a very dangerous man.
- I'm a very dangerous man.

00:17:15.742 --> 00:17:17.785
Look, let's go over there
and bust him.

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:20.121
You're not about to mess up
my massage, I'm telling you.

00:17:20.288 --> 00:17:21.288
Stay here.

00:17:21.456 --> 00:17:23.332
You don't need backup.
I got your back...

00:17:27.252 --> 00:17:29.712
Excuse me for a minute.
Just for a minute.

00:17:32.424 --> 00:17:35.093
I'll be back. Don't...

00:17:35.259 --> 00:17:37.135
I'll be back.

00:17:39.096 --> 00:17:41.556
Ricky? Ricky Tan?

00:17:41.724 --> 00:17:43.892
Get up, dog. I've been
lookin' for you everywhere.

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:46.352
I'm busy at the moment.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:49.521
You hear what I said? I'm busy too.
Now get on your feet.

00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:51.982
- Get on your feet!
- I know you.

00:17:52.149 --> 00:17:54.317
You are Lee's
American friend, right?

00:17:54.485 --> 00:17:57.237
I'm Lee's new muscle.
Don't let this robe fool you.

00:17:57.404 --> 00:18:00.239
This is the only color they had.
Now I said, get up.

00:18:00.407 --> 00:18:02.241
I ain't gonna say it again.

00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:06.161
You American are so funny.

00:18:06.287 --> 00:18:08.539
And you Asians
don't hear that well.

00:18:10.249 --> 00:18:12.209
Little Ricky!

00:18:12.334 --> 00:18:15.712
Get your little punk ass up...

00:18:15.837 --> 00:18:18.130
outta that chair right now!

00:18:19.716 --> 00:18:23.302
You're messin' up my vacation.
I told you to get up, didn't I?

00:18:23.427 --> 00:18:25.095
Now I gotta go off on you.

00:18:25.221 --> 00:18:27.014
Let me bust his ass.
Come on!

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:28.807
What?
Let me take care of this.

00:18:29.016 --> 00:18:30.850
Hello, my friend, how are you?

00:18:31.184 --> 00:18:32.518
I need to talk to you.

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:33.978
What about?

00:18:35.104 --> 00:18:36.355
The two Americans that were killed.

00:18:36.564 --> 00:18:37.940
Come to the police station.

00:18:39.275 --> 00:18:40.484
The police station?

00:18:41.443 --> 00:18:44.320
If you have any questions, ask me
here.

00:18:46.072 --> 00:18:49.032
Look, little man.
You comin' with...

00:18:49.158 --> 00:18:51.076
Oh, my Lord.

00:18:51.202 --> 00:18:53.495
I would like to pay you
for that laptop.

00:18:53.621 --> 00:18:55.581
- I think I should do that.
- No problem.

00:18:55.706 --> 00:18:57.999
I seen it on the Internet,
with a DVD player.

00:18:58.125 --> 00:19:00.627
- That's an old model.
- Now, I must excuse myself.

00:19:00.752 --> 00:19:02.503
Inspector.

00:19:02.629 --> 00:19:04.380
Have a good day.

00:19:07.675 --> 00:19:09.134
I was...

00:19:11.512 --> 00:19:15.265
Lee, why didn't you tell me
this man rolls like this?

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.183
- I told you already!
- No, you didn't!

00:19:17.308 --> 00:19:18.892
- What you said?
- I did this.

00:19:19.018 --> 00:19:20.852
What do this mean?
Speak English to me!

00:19:20.978 --> 00:19:23.480
That means I go this way
and you go this way.

00:19:23.606 --> 00:19:25.983
- I go that way, you go this way?
- Yes.

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:43.915
- Sorry.
- Carter!

00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:45.792
Y'all look alike!
Watch out!

00:20:15.026 --> 00:20:17.194
No wonder you mad.

00:20:30.373 --> 00:20:32.291
Don't worry. It's okay.

00:20:35.378 --> 00:20:37.546
You better get
the hell outta here.

00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:47.555
- Flip me!
- What?

00:20:47.722 --> 00:20:49.056
Flip me!

00:20:50.058 --> 00:20:50.975
Damn!

00:20:52.059 --> 00:20:53.852
Lee!

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:06.738
No, no, no!

00:21:31.636 --> 00:21:32.678
Lee!

00:21:43.605 --> 00:21:46.190
YAU MA TEI POLICE STATION

00:21:46.566 --> 00:21:50.277
Look, you've been ordered
by the Ministry of Public Security...

00:21:50.403 --> 00:21:54.281
to assist the F.B.I. And Secret Service
in our investigation...

00:21:54.406 --> 00:21:56.699
to provide us
with whatever we need.

00:21:56.825 --> 00:22:00.369
You have information,
it belongs to us.

00:22:00.495 --> 00:22:02.371
This is still Hong Kong.

00:22:03.498 --> 00:22:07.042
Two Americans have been killed
on United States government property.

00:22:07.168 --> 00:22:09.044
Give me two copies of that.

00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:11.462
This is our investigation.

00:22:11.588 --> 00:22:14.632
Chief Inspector Lee
will supervise your people.

00:22:14.758 --> 00:22:16.968
No, he will report to me.

00:22:17.093 --> 00:22:19.345
Do we understand each other?

00:22:24.933 --> 00:22:27.059
What the hell is that?

00:22:27.185 --> 00:22:29.645
That is, uh...

00:22:29.771 --> 00:22:31.439
Chief Inspector Lee.

00:22:31.564 --> 00:22:34.024
I ain't never been humiliated
and embarrassed like that...

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.026
in my whole entire life.

00:22:36.152 --> 00:22:39.655
Got me runnin' around Hong Kong
butt-naked, thanks to you.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.656
- Thanks to me?
- Yeah, thanks to you.

00:22:41.782 --> 00:22:43.867
You needed backup,
so I gave you backup.

00:22:43.992 --> 00:22:47.286
I was about to kick Ricky Tan's ass, and
his bodyguards', till you messed it up.

00:22:47.412 --> 00:22:50.372
- Stop. I'm sick of your bullshit.
- I'm sick of you!

00:22:50.498 --> 00:22:52.916
I'm not the one runnin' up
in karaoke bars full of gangsters.

00:22:53.042 --> 00:22:56.086
And I'm not the one runnin' up in
massage parlors lookin' for crime lords.

00:22:56.211 --> 00:22:58.337
- It's my job.
- It's your job.

00:22:58.463 --> 00:23:01.006
You pitiful, man.
When are you gonna have some fun?

00:23:01.132 --> 00:23:04.051
When are you gonna take a day off?
When are you gonna go on a date?

00:23:04.177 --> 00:23:07.054
- I have plenty of dates.
- When's the last time you had a date?

00:23:07.179 --> 00:23:10.014
When's the last time you played
"hide the rainbow roll"?

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.226
Huh? Let's hear it, Lee.
The Year of the Rat?

00:23:13.351 --> 00:23:15.311
You will never understand me.

00:23:15.437 --> 00:23:18.648
You right, 'cause I didn't even
understand what you just said to me.

00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:27.447
They got my passport
back at that massage parlor.

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:32.201
Good afternoon, sir.

00:23:32.327 --> 00:23:33.870
- Lee?
- Yes, sir.

00:23:33.995 --> 00:23:37.873
This is Special Agent Sterling
from the United States Secret Service.

00:23:37.998 --> 00:23:39.874
Secret Service? Why?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.876
Have a seat, please.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.214
What I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

00:23:46.339 --> 00:23:50.217
The men who were killed yesterday
were not American translators.

00:23:50.343 --> 00:23:52.845
They were undercover
United States Customs agents...

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.013
trying to break
a Triad smuggling ring.

00:23:55.139 --> 00:23:57.015
- Smuggling what?
- We don't know.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.183
But whatever it is,
it got the agents killed.

00:24:01.895 --> 00:24:03.271
How can we help you?

00:24:03.396 --> 00:24:05.648
You can stay the hell
out of our way.

00:24:07.942 --> 00:24:11.611
- Thank you.
- I can get you Ricky Tan.

00:24:11.778 --> 00:24:14.071
No. We know all about Tan.

00:24:14.197 --> 00:24:16.407
That's why we're leaving
him out there as bait.

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:19.285
This is a lot bigger
than Ricky Tan...

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.953
and the Fu Cang Long Triads.

00:24:27.209 --> 00:24:28.835
Hey, cutie.

00:24:50.438 --> 00:24:52.314
Thank you, Lee.

00:25:21.841 --> 00:25:23.717
Carter! Carter!

00:25:25.594 --> 00:25:28.012
Heaven on Earth massage parlor?

00:25:29.848 --> 00:25:31.724
Heaven on Earth?

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.976
Hello. Cheap suits.

00:25:35.102 --> 00:25:38.188
Hello. Cheap suits.
Cheap suits.

00:25:38.314 --> 00:25:40.524
- Cheap suits. Cheap suits.
- How cheap?

00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:43.359
- Cheap suits.
- Cheap as hell?

00:26:00.083 --> 00:26:01.792
Excuse me.

00:26:01.918 --> 00:26:05.212
Can you direct me to Heaven on Earth
massage parlor, please?

00:26:05.338 --> 00:26:08.090
- Hello. How are you?
- Okay.

00:26:09.842 --> 00:26:11.843
No, no.
Wait a minute.

00:26:11.968 --> 00:26:13.886
I don't want no chicken.

00:26:17.348 --> 00:26:20.350
I don't want no chicken!
What am I gonna do with a chicken?

00:26:21.435 --> 00:26:23.395
I don't like
my chickens live, okay?

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.855
I like 'em dead and deep-fried.
You ever heard of Popeye's?

00:26:28.525 --> 00:26:31.527
No, no! No!
Don't kill chicken.

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:34.071
Yes.

00:26:34.197 --> 00:26:36.240
I'm warning you.
I'm a police officer.

00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:38.742
Put the blade down
and let the bird go right now!

00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:48.917
You okay, Lee?

00:26:51.879 --> 00:26:54.256
All he wanted was some mu sh...

00:27:09.478 --> 00:27:10.437
Damn.

00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:14.357
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

00:27:17.652 --> 00:27:19.570
Follow that car.

00:27:21.071 --> 00:27:24.657
Follow that limo. This is a chase.
Wherever he goes, you go.

00:27:24.783 --> 00:27:28.286
You're not movin'!
This is the opposite of chasin'!

00:27:29.496 --> 00:27:32.582
What? I will slap you
if you don't move this car.

00:27:32.707 --> 00:27:35.501
I'm gonna slap you.
I'm gonna slap you.

00:27:35.626 --> 00:27:38.420
All right.
Okay, look. Here.

00:27:38.545 --> 00:27:40.463
You understand that?

00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:46.719
- Now you're speaking my language.
- Get the hell on then.

00:27:46.886 --> 00:27:48.929
Come on, let's go!

00:28:36.764 --> 00:28:42.102
We just heard Ricky Tan is throwing
a party on his boat tonight.

00:28:43.228 --> 00:28:44.479
Did you tell Sterling?

00:28:44.813 --> 00:28:48.649
Let him find out on his own. I want
the Hong Kong Police handling this.

00:29:17.008 --> 00:29:19.760
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.

00:29:19.885 --> 00:29:22.845
- You understand?
- Yes, I understand!

00:29:22.971 --> 00:29:25.139
And don't eat my chicken, okay?

00:29:26.725 --> 00:29:28.101
Jesus!

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.676
How you doin', baby?

00:30:52.801 --> 00:30:56.179
Carter, James Carter.
Baldwin Hills.

00:30:56.304 --> 00:30:58.389
Isabella Molina.
From San Juan.

00:30:58.515 --> 00:31:00.725
San Juan?
I know San Juan.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.852
I've traveled there many times
on my private plane.

00:31:03.978 --> 00:31:09.024
You must know my friend Pedro Morales
Magonzales Marato Molaso Mondustos.

00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:11.401
- I don't think so.
- You sure?

00:31:11.526 --> 00:31:14.236
Well, I'm sorry. I thought
you rode in the best circles.

00:31:14.362 --> 00:31:16.572
But listen.
Make yourself feel at home.

00:31:16.697 --> 00:31:20.783
You need anything... champagne,
caviar... my yacht is your yacht.

00:31:22.202 --> 00:31:23.578
This is your yacht?

00:31:23.704 --> 00:31:25.747
That's right.
I'm the owner.

00:31:25.872 --> 00:31:28.582
The captain.
El capitan.

00:31:28.708 --> 00:31:31.794
- El capitan?
- Yes. Listen.

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:35.588
I'm not gonna play games with you.
I want you right now.

00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:38.591
I see me and you downstairs
in one of those bathrooms...

00:31:38.717 --> 00:31:40.593
in about five minutes.

00:31:40.719 --> 00:31:44.055
Well, I'm very tempted.
It's such a beautiful yacht.

00:31:46.307 --> 00:31:47.474
What's it called?

00:31:47.642 --> 00:31:50.728
- What's it called?
- Mm-hmm. Your yacht.

00:31:50.853 --> 00:31:54.898
- The S.S. Minnow Johnson.
- The S.S. Minnow Johnson?

00:31:55.023 --> 00:31:57.692
Funny. The name on the back
was The Red Dragon.

00:31:57.859 --> 00:31:59.610
The Red Dragon?
Are you sure?

00:31:59.777 --> 00:32:03.029
Oh, I'm sure.
Because this is my friend's yacht.

00:32:03.197 --> 00:32:05.282
- Your friend's yacht?
- And this is his party.

00:32:05.449 --> 00:32:09.118
I must've got on the wrong yacht.
All these yachts look alike these days.

00:32:09.286 --> 00:32:12.205
I knew somethin' was wrong
when my key didn't work.

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:16.500
- Who's your friend?
- Somebody on the wrong yacht.

00:32:16.626 --> 00:32:19.461
Wait a second. I know you.
Steven Reign, right?

00:32:19.587 --> 00:32:22.756
You own half of Los Angeles.
What you doin' here in Hong Kong?

00:32:22.881 --> 00:32:25.091
I'm here for the weekend,
taking in the sights.

00:32:25.217 --> 00:32:28.303
You must have your own plane too.
It's fun, ain't it?

00:32:29.137 --> 00:32:31.013
- Shall we?
- Yes.

00:32:32.431 --> 00:32:34.724
Well, enjoy the party,
Mr. Carter.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.726
I plan to, Ms. Isabella.

00:32:36.852 --> 00:32:40.313
See you later, Stevie.
Be cool.

00:32:53.742 --> 00:32:56.828
- Ricky Tan. Where is he?
- I don't know!

00:32:56.953 --> 00:32:59.913
He killed a detective today.
Where is he?

00:33:00.039 --> 00:33:01.748
Who got killed, man?

00:33:02.667 --> 00:33:04.752
- Carter!
- Who died, Lee?

00:33:04.877 --> 00:33:06.837
- You!
- Detective Yu?

00:33:06.962 --> 00:33:08.838
- Not Yu, you!
- Who?

00:33:08.964 --> 00:33:10.340
- You!
- Who?

00:33:10.465 --> 00:33:14.301
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

00:33:14.427 --> 00:33:17.971
Don't nobody understand the words
that are comin' out of your mouth, man.

00:33:18.097 --> 00:33:20.640
Ricky Tan is waiting for you.

00:33:26.062 --> 00:33:28.439
What the hell
is going on here, Lee?

00:33:28.565 --> 00:33:31.108
Remember I told you
my father was a policeman?

00:33:31.234 --> 00:33:33.360
- Ricky Tan was his partner.
- What?

00:33:33.736 --> 00:33:35.821
Hu Li, you disappoint me.

00:33:37.072 --> 00:33:38.906
Have you forgotten where you're
from?

00:33:40.117 --> 00:33:42.035
Don't forget who you work for.

00:33:43.077 --> 00:33:45.704
You think you could ever be a
leader?

00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:56.589
Lee, I've been expecting you.

00:33:56.715 --> 00:33:58.716
Please ask your partner
to wait inside.

00:33:58.841 --> 00:34:01.384
- I ain't goin' nowhere.
- It's okay.

00:34:01.511 --> 00:34:04.138
- I'm not leavin' you alone.
- I'll be fine.

00:34:04.263 --> 00:34:06.264
- You sure?
- Yes.

00:34:07.683 --> 00:34:09.893
I'll be right upstairs.

00:34:12.729 --> 00:34:14.814
I know what everybody's saying.

00:34:14.939 --> 00:34:17.858
I did not blow up
the American embassy.

00:34:17.983 --> 00:34:19.901
I'm not that stupid.

00:34:21.195 --> 00:34:24.030
But I believe
some of my people did.

00:34:24.156 --> 00:34:27.742
My enemies
are trying to frame me.

00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:31.245
There is a war going on
right now within the Triads.

00:34:32.621 --> 00:34:34.539
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose this time.

00:34:36.333 --> 00:34:39.043
If your father were still alive,
I would turn to him for advice.

00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:41.462
Please don't.

00:34:41.588 --> 00:34:44.799
Lee, I really need your help.
I cannot trust anybody else.

00:34:44.924 --> 00:34:47.551
Tell me why they killed
the customs agents.

00:34:47.677 --> 00:34:50.512
I'll give you all
the information you need...

00:34:50.637 --> 00:34:54.557
but you've gotta get me
out of Hong Kong right away.

00:35:36.929 --> 00:35:38.430
Lady, what are you doin'?

00:35:38.597 --> 00:35:40.932
Get down.
I'm L.A.P.D.

00:35:42.851 --> 00:35:46.354
You just kick me?
You must be outta your mind!

00:35:46.479 --> 00:35:49.815
You want some of me? I'm gonna
give you an L.A.P.D. Ass-kickin'!

00:36:16.088 --> 00:36:18.048
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:36:18.174 --> 00:36:20.884
I slipped and I fell. Hey.

00:36:21.009 --> 00:36:22.969
- What?
- Am I bleedin'?

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.900
Quite a night, Inspector.

00:36:39.025 --> 00:36:42.236
Ricky Tan was our only bait.
Now he's gone.

00:36:42.362 --> 00:36:46.740
So you got your revenge, at the expense
of a U.S. Government investigation.

00:36:46.866 --> 00:36:48.742
What are you talkin'
about, revenge?

00:36:48.868 --> 00:36:51.662
Now, I don't know if the Triads
paid you to get rid of Tan...

00:36:51.787 --> 00:36:54.122
or if it was a pure
vendetta killing...

00:36:54.247 --> 00:36:57.666
or if you're involved in the smuggling
yourself, but you're off this case.

00:36:57.792 --> 00:37:00.169
I don't ever wanna see you again.
Is that clear?

00:37:00.294 --> 00:37:03.129
- What's goin' on here?
- Carter, you're in enough trouble.

00:37:03.255 --> 00:37:06.007
Just shut up.
Stay out of it.

00:37:06.133 --> 00:37:08.176
You're goin' back to L.A.
Right now.

00:37:08.301 --> 00:37:12.012
That's fine with me, man.
I ain't had fun since I been out here.

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.851
Sorry, Lee.

00:37:19.687 --> 00:37:21.355
Escort Detective Carter
to the airport.

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:25.150
I'll take him.

00:37:25.275 --> 00:37:26.692
Get your hands off!

00:37:34.408 --> 00:37:38.453
- Carter, you don't understand.
- I understand, all right.

00:37:38.578 --> 00:37:40.955
I got knocked off a building,
I got beat on...

00:37:41.081 --> 00:37:44.750
I got stripped butt-naked,
and you held out on me, man.

00:37:44.876 --> 00:37:47.044
I'm outta here.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.386
Carter, Ricky Tan
set up my father.

00:37:57.929 --> 00:37:59.180
What?

00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:08.271
Five years ago, my father was working
a big international smuggling case.

00:38:08.438 --> 00:38:11.315
He found out his partner, Tan,
was working for the Triads.

00:38:11.441 --> 00:38:15.569
But before he could prove it,
he was killed.

00:38:15.695 --> 00:38:17.655
All the evidence disappeared...

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.240
Tan resigned,
and the case was never solved.

00:38:22.284 --> 00:38:24.827
I get it now. This is all about
your daddy's last case.

00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:32.209
You gettin' on the plane
with me or not?

00:38:32.334 --> 00:38:33.501
What?

00:38:33.669 --> 00:38:36.379
You know my daddy
died on the job too.

00:38:36.505 --> 00:38:39.340
If I had a chance to square his death,
I'd do whatever it took.

00:38:39.466 --> 00:38:42.885
I'd do anything.
So you comin' or what?

00:38:48.974 --> 00:38:50.141
Why L. A?

00:38:53.603 --> 00:38:56.897
Lee, let me introduce you to Carter's
theory of criminal investigation:

00:38:57.065 --> 00:38:58.899
Follow the rich white man.

00:38:59.066 --> 00:39:02.861
- Follow the rich white man?
- Exactly. Now you're learning.

00:39:03.028 --> 00:39:06.447
Every big crime has a rich white man
behind it waitin' for his cut.

00:39:06.615 --> 00:39:08.950
Now in our case,
we know who the rich white man is.

00:39:09.117 --> 00:39:10.951
- Steven Reign.
- Who?

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.829
Steven Reign, the hotel billionaire.
I saw him on Ricky Tan's boat.

00:39:13.996 --> 00:39:16.331
When the shootin' started,
he was way too cool.

00:39:16.457 --> 00:39:18.959
When people start shootin',
white people ain't that cool.

00:39:19.084 --> 00:39:21.377
They either runnin' around,
hidin' behind tables...

00:39:21.503 --> 00:39:24.547
or screamin' like, "aah!"

00:39:24.673 --> 00:39:26.257
You sound like that
all the time.

00:39:26.382 --> 00:39:28.342
Let me tell you somethin'
about black people.

00:39:28.468 --> 00:39:30.845
When stuff goes down,
we keep our cool.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.181
Maybe, but not like Asians.
We never panic.

00:39:34.306 --> 00:39:36.933
Right. When Godzilla's comin',
y'all be trippin'.

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:39.686
I seen the movie.
You be, "Gaica, gaica!"

00:39:39.811 --> 00:39:41.645
Yellin' everywhere.
I seen Chinamen...

00:39:41.771 --> 00:39:43.272
Mr. Carter, excuse me.

00:39:43.398 --> 00:39:45.650
Thank you so much.
It's the kosher meal?

00:39:45.775 --> 00:39:48.902
- Yes, that is our kosher meal.
- Shalom.

00:39:54.532 --> 00:39:56.867
REIGN TOWERS Los Angeles.

00:40:02.373 --> 00:40:05.083
There he is, right there,
Mr. Steven Reign...

00:40:05.209 --> 00:40:07.836
livin' large in one
of his penthouse suites.

00:40:09.838 --> 00:40:13.549
Oh, guess who this is.
Yep, that's her.

00:40:13.674 --> 00:40:16.676
That's the woman that was
on Ricky Tan's boat, right there.

00:40:16.802 --> 00:40:18.386
We got 'em.

00:40:18.512 --> 00:40:21.222
Told you it'd work out.
Know what I'm talkin' about.

00:40:21.348 --> 00:40:23.308
All we gotta do now is wait.

00:40:24.684 --> 00:40:26.101
They still talkin'?

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:28.979
He's leaving.

00:40:29.105 --> 00:40:31.065
- He'll be back.
- How do you know?

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.316
I know. You see how fine
that woman is?

00:40:33.442 --> 00:40:35.527
He'll definitely be back.

00:40:41.991 --> 00:40:43.659
What's she doing?

00:40:46.537 --> 00:40:48.413
What's she doin', man?

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:51.416
She's just standing around,
not doing much.

00:40:51.541 --> 00:40:55.794
Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later,
something's gonna happen.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.673
Okay, I just try to stay awake.
It's just so boring.

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:06.513
Oh. Slow down, baby.

00:41:06.638 --> 00:41:07.805
What?

00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:11.851
- Nothing. I said nothing.
- You said somethin'.

00:41:11.976 --> 00:41:13.810
- I said nothing.
- I heard you.

00:41:13.936 --> 00:41:16.188
No. Nothing.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.367
Lee, what's goin' on?
What you talkin' about?

00:41:30.493 --> 00:41:33.287
- She's getting undressed.
- What?

00:41:33.412 --> 00:41:35.622
- She's just getting undressed.
- Give me that!

00:41:35.747 --> 00:41:38.833
No! It's not right!

00:41:38.959 --> 00:41:41.502
- Lord, have mercy!
- What?

00:41:41.669 --> 00:41:44.171
- She took her skirt off.
- I cannot hear this.

00:41:44.297 --> 00:41:46.674
Black panties, black bra...

00:41:46.799 --> 00:41:50.885
Victoria's Secret,
spring catalogue, page 27.

00:41:51.011 --> 00:41:52.512
Girl got class.

00:41:52.637 --> 00:41:55.472
Let me look a little closer.
Oh, look at that.

00:41:55.598 --> 00:41:57.599
Got a little tattoo.
That's cute.

00:41:57.725 --> 00:41:59.851
Looks like Snoopy.

00:42:00.019 --> 00:42:01.395
- Snoopy?
- Yeah.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.689
- I love Snoopy.
- I love Snoopy too. Let me look.

00:42:04.857 --> 00:42:06.733
Hold up.
Wait a minute.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.527
She's goin' to the door.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:12.571
She's openin' the door.

00:42:14.115 --> 00:42:16.575
Look like somebody
droppin' off a package.

00:42:16.742 --> 00:42:18.702
Wait a minute.

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:22.455
Look like the same girl who dropped
off the package at your office.

00:42:22.622 --> 00:42:23.998
It's a bomb!

00:42:25.375 --> 00:42:26.751
Watch out!

00:42:31.463 --> 00:42:34.423
It's this one right here.
Lady, you got a bomb in there!

00:42:34.591 --> 00:42:36.384
Open that door!

00:42:36.551 --> 00:42:38.385
Kick the door.

00:42:41.681 --> 00:42:43.557
- Damn, you fine.
- Carter!

00:42:45.434 --> 00:42:47.394
- Come on, Lee!
- Where?

00:42:47.519 --> 00:42:50.730
- Don't drop it! This way!
- Where should we go?

00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:56.985
Roof! Roof!

00:42:57.111 --> 00:42:59.071
Don't trip! Be careful!

00:43:02.283 --> 00:43:04.409
- Throw it, Lee!
- Where?

00:43:04.535 --> 00:43:07.329
Lee, throw it!
Throw the bomb over the edge!

00:43:07.454 --> 00:43:08.830
Throw it! Throw it!

00:43:08.955 --> 00:43:11.165
- Throw it over the edge!
- There's people down there!

00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:13.960
- Lee, throw it!
- Carter!

00:43:14.085 --> 00:43:16.337
- Lee! Throw it!
- No!

00:43:16.462 --> 00:43:18.338
We about to die!

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.429
Okay, get on your feet.

00:43:27.555 --> 00:43:29.681
- Enough, all right?
- Put that down!

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:31.683
- It's a bomb!
- Put that down!

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.728
Guys, no bomb.
Nothing.

00:43:34.853 --> 00:43:38.522
Now stay away before I throw you
both in jail for obstruction.

00:43:38.648 --> 00:43:40.649
Throw us in jail?

00:43:40.775 --> 00:43:43.485
You must be outta your mind.
I'm about to bust you right now.

00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:46.571
I'm an undercover agent for
the United States Secret Service.

00:43:46.697 --> 00:43:49.407
How do we know that?
Show me a badge right now.

00:43:49.533 --> 00:43:51.493
Here you go.

00:43:52.994 --> 00:43:56.205
Let me see that again.
I didn't get a good look at that.

00:43:56.331 --> 00:43:59.041
We can help you.
I'm a detective from Hong Kong.

00:43:59.166 --> 00:44:01.709
I know who you are,
Inspector Lee. I know.

00:44:01.835 --> 00:44:05.171
We need to go out of sight,
so come down to my suite.

00:44:08.133 --> 00:44:10.676
- Why did you say it was a bomb?
- No, you said that.

00:44:10.802 --> 00:44:13.012
- No, you said it.
- You said that in the hotel room.

00:44:13.137 --> 00:44:15.097
I said she was the bomb.

00:44:16.765 --> 00:44:18.641
She was the bomb?

00:44:18.767 --> 00:44:21.561
Look, I've been working
this case for months now...

00:44:21.686 --> 00:44:23.687
so if I seem a little
aggravated, I apologize.

00:44:23.813 --> 00:44:25.689
You need to tell us
what's goin' on.

00:44:25.815 --> 00:44:28.442
The Triads and Reign think
I'm a crooked customs agent.

00:44:28.567 --> 00:44:31.778
- Is that a payoff?
- No. That's a sample.

00:44:31.904 --> 00:44:33.905
You guys ever heard
of the Superbill?

00:44:34.031 --> 00:44:36.408
I heard of it. It's a myth.
Some kind of counterfeit.

00:44:36.533 --> 00:44:39.994
Honey, it's much more
than a counterfeit.

00:44:40.119 --> 00:44:43.288
Fourteen out of fifteen world banks
can't even tell the difference.

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:44.998
The paper is Crane linen blend...

00:44:45.124 --> 00:44:48.001
and the bills are printed
on U.S. Intaglio presses.

00:44:48.127 --> 00:44:51.004
You wanna tell us how they get into
the U.S. Mint to use the presses?

00:44:51.129 --> 00:44:54.673
In 1959, the United States was
very friendly with the Shah of Iran.

00:44:54.799 --> 00:44:57.176
Why? Because we wanted his oil.

00:44:57.301 --> 00:44:59.177
Our government
gave him a gift...

00:44:59.303 --> 00:45:01.263
a U.S. Treasury
intaglio printing press.

00:45:01.388 --> 00:45:03.556
Now, it's the only one
to ever leave the country.

00:45:03.682 --> 00:45:06.267
Five years ago, Ricky Tan bought
the press on the black market.

00:45:06.393 --> 00:45:08.102
Five years ago?

00:45:08.228 --> 00:45:10.188
That's right before
he left the force.

00:45:10.313 --> 00:45:13.899
Ricky Tan got hold of one-of-a-kind
Swiss-made hundred-dollar plates...

00:45:14.025 --> 00:45:15.901
and he started printing
Superbills.

00:45:16.026 --> 00:45:18.695
That's why Hu Li killed him...
for the plates.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.865
And they've printed and shipped
one hundred million dollars.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.662
There's only one way
to spot a fake.

00:45:28.788 --> 00:45:31.748
They use an optical transfer ink
from India that burns red.

00:45:31.874 --> 00:45:35.627
You see? Now, the real ink,
it burns black.

00:45:39.797 --> 00:45:42.883
You know, Carter, I believe
you're asking the wrong question.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.636
The real question is,
where are the plates?

00:45:46.804 --> 00:45:50.140
Because if we can find the plates,
we can stop the whole operation.

00:45:50.265 --> 00:45:53.017
- Right?
- Yeah, you're right.

00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:55.936
Maybe this is where
you can help us, guys.

00:45:56.104 --> 00:45:59.356
Yeah. Carter,
this is your city, right?

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:02.651
Yeah, this is my titty.
I mean, this is my city.

00:46:02.776 --> 00:46:06.779
Great. And Lee, you know
Hu Li and the Triads, correct?

00:46:06.905 --> 00:46:08.906
- Yes.
- Great.

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:12.993
Can you do me a favor? Can you find out
where Hu Li's keeping the plates?

00:46:13.119 --> 00:46:15.287
- That ain't no problem.
- Thank you.

00:46:15.412 --> 00:46:17.372
So welcome aboard, gentlemen.

00:46:17.498 --> 00:46:21.418
From now on, you're officially working
for the United States Secret Service.

00:46:23.878 --> 00:46:26.880
Secret Service agent
James Carter.

00:46:27.006 --> 00:46:30.258
That sounds good.
It's got a nice ring to it, don't it?

00:46:30.384 --> 00:46:32.260
I'm tellin' you, Lee,
give me six months.

00:46:32.386 --> 00:46:35.889
Six months and I'll be in Washington,
D.C., protectin' the president.

00:46:36.014 --> 00:46:38.641
We both know you would never
take a bullet for someone else.

00:46:38.766 --> 00:46:40.642
Yeah, but they don't know that.

00:46:40.768 --> 00:46:43.311
I'm gonna talk to Isabella,
see if she can hook somethin' up.

00:46:43.437 --> 00:46:47.315
- Seein' how she stared at a brother.
- She never even look at you.

00:46:47.441 --> 00:46:49.901
Just jealous, Lee,
'cause the girl chose me...

00:46:50.026 --> 00:46:53.404
'cause I'm tall, dark and handsome,
and you Third-World ugly.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.740
I'm not Third-World ugly.
Women like me.

00:46:55.865 --> 00:46:58.992
They think I'm cute,
like Snoopy.

00:46:59.118 --> 00:47:01.953
Lee, Snoopy is six inches
taller than you.

00:47:06.166 --> 00:47:09.168
Lee and Carter are officially
out of the Secret Service's way.

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:11.169
Correct.

00:47:29.854 --> 00:47:33.357
This is my informant's place.
They got pretty good ribs here too.

00:47:33.482 --> 00:47:35.358
I like kosher.

00:47:44.074 --> 00:47:45.992
Hey. Hey, wait.

00:47:53.541 --> 00:47:56.919
Oh, I know I don't think I see
what I see what I'm thinkin'!

00:47:57.044 --> 00:47:59.421
I know good and well
y'all ain't gamblin' back here!

00:47:59.547 --> 00:48:02.424
- This is supposed to be a restaurant!
- What you doin' here, James?

00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:05.051
You about to go to jail,
and all your little friends.

00:48:05.177 --> 00:48:07.679
Everybody pack up your stuff
and let's get outta here.

00:48:07.804 --> 00:48:10.264
- All right, let's talk outside.
- You wanna talk outside?

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:11.265
Yes.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.476
Let's go if you wanna talk.
As long as you wanna talk.

00:48:17.938 --> 00:48:20.064
Where you get that from?
I like that.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:22.316
That's good.
What's up, Kenny?

00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:25.277
- James Carter.
- What's up?

00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:29.156
I heard you was gettin' your ass kicked
out there in Hong Kong, brother.

00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:31.157
- What?
- That's right.

00:48:31.283 --> 00:48:33.493
- Who told you that?
- I got my sources.

00:48:33.618 --> 00:48:36.203
- Don't you worry about that.
- They tellin' you lies.

00:48:36.329 --> 00:48:38.956
Look, I'm about to bust you
if you don't give me some information.

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:42.251
How you gonna come up here
and jam me up like this, James?

00:48:42.376 --> 00:48:46.462
You embarrass me in front
of my wife, my kids out there.

00:48:46.588 --> 00:48:48.464
Kenny, you embarrassin' yourself.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:51.133
You a black man with
a Chinese restaurant on Crenshaw.

00:48:51.259 --> 00:48:54.386
You come up in here,
you ain't show me no badge.

00:48:54.512 --> 00:48:56.472
You ain't even
flashed a warrant.

00:48:56.597 --> 00:49:00.809
Know what I'm gonna do for you?
I'm gonna whup your ass.

00:49:00.934 --> 00:49:02.810
And then I'm gonna
whup your ass.

00:49:02.936 --> 00:49:05.229
Kenny, we'd love to see that.
We would.

00:49:05.355 --> 00:49:07.148
- Come on, Kenny!
- Come on!

00:49:07.273 --> 00:49:08.357
- Come on!
- Do it!

00:49:08.483 --> 00:49:09.942
I'll shoot you and say
you fell in the kitchen.

00:49:10.068 --> 00:49:11.736
- Come on!
- You better chill out.

00:49:13.195 --> 00:49:15.196
- Kenny, calm down, Kenny!
- What...

00:49:25.748 --> 00:49:27.124
Twisting Tiger.

00:49:30.502 --> 00:49:31.836
Where did you learn that?

00:49:32.045 --> 00:49:33.671
Master Ching taught me.

00:49:34.214 --> 00:49:35.131
Master Ching from Beijing?

00:49:35.715 --> 00:49:37.258
No... Freddy Ching's in Crenshaw.

00:49:38.134 --> 00:49:40.260
Oh. They're brothers.

00:49:40.386 --> 00:49:42.638
Oh, all right, all right.

00:49:43.055 --> 00:49:45.015
Why are you hanging out with 7-11?

00:49:45.224 --> 00:49:46.391
7-11?

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:49.310
Because his mouth never closes.

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:55.691
Hey! I heard that.
I heard that.

00:49:55.817 --> 00:49:57.860
Don't be talkin' about me, man.

00:49:57.985 --> 00:50:00.737
- You're here about some funny money?
- How you know?

00:50:00.863 --> 00:50:03.156
- C-notes, right?
- Yeah.

00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:05.324
Any of 'em came through here?

00:50:06.951 --> 00:50:08.827
One of my regulars
came in a few days ago...

00:50:08.953 --> 00:50:11.788
dropped about 50 large
on the tables in there.

00:50:11.914 --> 00:50:14.666
I was about to go down there
with my boys and tune his ass up...

00:50:14.792 --> 00:50:16.835
but he comes in the next day
with the whole thing.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.754
Brand-new one hundred dollar
bills, sequential.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.715
I figure they're fake, 'cause
this guy's got a regular day job.

00:50:22.841 --> 00:50:25.218
So I test 'em,
and they checked out.

00:50:25.343 --> 00:50:27.511
You still have the bills?

00:50:27.636 --> 00:50:29.929
Still got my lunch money
from the third grade.

00:50:30.055 --> 00:50:31.306
Let me see 'em.

00:50:54.786 --> 00:50:57.163
Hold it.
What are you doin'?

00:51:03.502 --> 00:51:04.419
It's fake.

00:51:04.544 --> 00:51:07.504
He got you.
Who you say gave that to you?

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:10.590
Cat named Zing.
Work down at Reign Plaza.

00:51:10.758 --> 00:51:13.343
You better hope
you find him before I do.

00:51:37.615 --> 00:51:40.450
Excuse me. L.A.P.D.

00:51:40.576 --> 00:51:42.744
We're lookin' for
a guy named Zing.

00:51:45.247 --> 00:51:47.415
Come here!
Come back here!

00:51:47.582 --> 00:51:50.334
Hey! Hey!
You little rascal!

00:51:50.502 --> 00:51:54.213
Get back here!
Get back here right now!

00:52:05.598 --> 00:52:07.391
The great Chief Inspector Lee.

00:52:09.936 --> 00:52:12.855
I'll be remembered for
getting rid of you.

00:52:13.105 --> 00:52:15.440
Know what? I don't even know
why the hell I'm here.

00:52:15.607 --> 00:52:17.733
I ain't even Chinese.

00:52:17.859 --> 00:52:19.735
All right, I'm sorry.

00:52:21.529 --> 00:52:24.781
I think there's someone who
would like to talk to them first.

00:52:34.249 --> 00:52:36.459
What'd you do that for?
That was unnecessary!

00:52:42.131 --> 00:52:44.800
You knocked out my filling, girl.
That's gonna cost you.

00:52:48.136 --> 00:52:51.805
I ain't never hit a woman in my life,
but your ass is pushin' it!

00:52:55.226 --> 00:52:57.978
Okay, all right.
I'll go.

00:53:01.398 --> 00:53:03.274
Better watch your back.

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.267
What happened?

00:53:42.434 --> 00:53:45.812
That lady Isabella knock you out.
She played you.

00:53:45.938 --> 00:53:47.314
- No.
- Yes, she did.

00:53:47.439 --> 00:53:49.315
- She save our life.
- What?

00:53:49.441 --> 00:53:51.818
- Hu Li could have killed us.
- Are you crazy, man?

00:53:51.985 --> 00:53:54.362
Look at us.
We good as dead!

00:53:54.487 --> 00:53:57.489
- Stop your whining!
- What you gonna do if I don't stop?

00:53:57.615 --> 00:53:59.867
I will slap the hell
outta you right now, Lee.

00:54:01.952 --> 00:54:04.287
- I'll bitch-slap you back to Africa!
- You will?

00:54:04.412 --> 00:54:07.331
Let me see that.
I wanna see you do that!

00:54:07.457 --> 00:54:10.126
You don't know
who you're messin' with, man!

00:54:10.251 --> 00:54:12.127
You don't know
who you're messin' with, do you?

00:54:12.253 --> 00:54:15.213
- I'll bite your damn nose off.
- You bite... Come on!

00:54:26.807 --> 00:54:28.183
I don't trust her.

00:54:28.434 --> 00:54:30.268
It's a mistake having her here.

00:54:30.602 --> 00:54:33.396
Our orders are to leave her alone.

00:54:39.026 --> 00:54:42.195
I want to slice those pretty lips
right off her face

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:46.366
and bury her in the desert
with those two cops.

00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:50.953
Some apple?

00:54:53.164 --> 00:54:56.250
I'd put that knife away, bitch,
before you have an accident.

00:55:05.967 --> 00:55:08.427
Ain't no use, man.

00:55:08.553 --> 00:55:11.055
Just tell me how the Triads
are gonna kill us.

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:14.015
They will torture us
for three days.

00:55:14.141 --> 00:55:18.394
- I can handle that.
- Then they'll cut off our egg rolls.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.730
Cut off our egg rolls?
Hell, no!

00:55:20.855 --> 00:55:24.233
Let's get the hell outta here!
Come on, don't give up!

00:55:31.907 --> 00:55:34.492
- I don't wanna die!
- Be quiet.

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.662
- Okay, give me your left leg.
- What for?

00:55:38.788 --> 00:55:39.830
Left leg!

00:55:39.956 --> 00:55:41.332
Like this.

00:55:43.751 --> 00:55:45.627
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

00:55:56.679 --> 00:55:58.972
That's it.
Bite that thing.

00:55:59.098 --> 00:56:01.099
Bite it like a little monkey!

00:56:01.224 --> 00:56:03.225
Bite it! There you go.

00:56:03.351 --> 00:56:05.686
Yank it!
Use them tiger teeth!

00:56:05.812 --> 00:56:08.147
Yeah! Grab it!
Pull on it!

00:56:08.272 --> 00:56:10.607
You almost got it.
That's it.

00:56:10.733 --> 00:56:12.609
Oh, shit!

00:56:12.735 --> 00:56:15.153
- What the hell?
- Wow!

00:56:15.279 --> 00:56:17.614
Lee, untie me.
Hurry up, man!

00:56:19.282 --> 00:56:21.492
All these statues full of money.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.376
Hello, Benjamin!

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.965
- What are you doing?
- I'm takin' this for evidence.

00:56:42.594 --> 00:56:43.803
You feel that?

00:56:43.929 --> 00:56:46.181
Yeah. We slowin' down, man.

00:57:01.194 --> 00:57:03.571
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

00:57:06.074 --> 00:57:07.992
Come on, Lee!

00:57:12.246 --> 00:57:14.164
Carter, go up.

00:57:45.233 --> 00:57:46.817
- What happened?
- You left me.

00:57:46.943 --> 00:57:49.236
I didn't leave you.
I was waitin' up there for you.

00:58:04.501 --> 00:58:06.377
Whoa, man!
I ain't goin' in there!

00:58:06.502 --> 00:58:08.378
- Come on!
- There's rats in there!

00:58:08.504 --> 00:58:10.589
- There's no rats!
- Look at that rat!

00:58:31.775 --> 00:58:33.776
Las Vegas?

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:38.656
What the hell we doin' in Vegas?

00:58:38.781 --> 00:58:41.199
Look.
Red Dragon.

00:58:41.325 --> 00:58:43.994
That's the name
of Ricky Tan's boat.

00:58:44.119 --> 00:58:46.079
Lee.

00:58:49.415 --> 00:58:52.042
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:58:52.168 --> 00:58:53.627
- Sorry.
- Damn!

00:58:53.753 --> 00:58:56.296
One at a time.
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:59:01.218 --> 00:59:02.552
- Wait a second, man.
- What?

00:59:02.677 --> 00:59:04.553
- We can't go in there like this.
- Why?

00:59:04.679 --> 00:59:06.889
- We got to look fly.
- What you mean, "fly"?

00:59:07.014 --> 00:59:08.890
We got to mack out.
We can't go in like this.

00:59:09.016 --> 00:59:10.392
What does it mean, "mack out"?

00:59:10.518 --> 00:59:12.895
Follow me, my Asian brother.
I'll show you.

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:14.980
Come on.

00:59:22.695 --> 00:59:24.321
That's where we're going.

00:59:24.447 --> 00:59:26.615
When we get in there,
you stay a couple steps behind me.

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.784
You smell a little funky.
I think you stepped in rat shit.

00:59:30.869 --> 00:59:34.205
It was a cowboy hat,
and now it's a pith helmet.

00:59:34.330 --> 00:59:36.582
Hold on.
Talk to you in a bit.

00:59:36.707 --> 00:59:38.208
Hi.
Can I help you?

00:59:38.334 --> 00:59:41.128
Yeah, I'm gonna need
black, 42 long...

00:59:41.253 --> 00:59:43.546
and nothing touches this body
but pure silk.

00:59:43.672 --> 00:59:46.257
And get my partner something
from the kids' department.

00:59:46.383 --> 00:59:48.301
Would your partner like to be
wrapped in silk as well?

00:59:48.426 --> 00:59:51.804
Some people think it's tacky,
but I enjoy it when couples dress alike.

00:59:51.929 --> 00:59:54.139
No, this ain't no
couple thing, man.

00:59:54.265 --> 00:59:56.850
We're police officers on
a dangerous case, and we need clothes.

00:59:56.975 --> 00:59:58.851
Yes.
There are a lot of men chasing us.

00:59:58.977 --> 01:00:01.979
As well they should be.
You have nothing to worry about, okay?

01:00:02.105 --> 01:00:04.023
Because I'm gonna turn you two
into the belle of the ball.

01:00:04.149 --> 01:00:06.984
- Thank you.
- Absolutely. Let's start with you.

01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:10.737
You've got a mochaccino face, wonderful
skin, and the big, broad shoulders.

01:00:10.863 --> 01:00:13.573
Let's put a dead animal
on you. Croc skin.

01:00:13.699 --> 01:00:15.575
Butter cream, croc skin,
butter cream...

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.618
What size is the waist?
Let's go in.

01:00:17.744 --> 01:00:19.996
Hey!
Watch it, sweetness!

01:00:20.121 --> 01:00:22.539
- He's got some fire to him.
- Honey cups!

01:00:22.665 --> 01:00:24.791
- I like that.
- Go get the clothes! Hurry up!

01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:28.712
I'll pull some items.
Oh, Jesus. Li'l Kim, I'll be back.

01:00:28.837 --> 01:00:32.465
- You see that?
- He likes you.

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:35.008
I'm not shopping
with you no more.

01:00:44.017 --> 01:00:46.811
- Act like you're rich.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

01:00:46.937 --> 01:00:48.980
Steven Reign...

01:00:49.105 --> 01:00:53.442
owner and founder
of the Red Dragon Casino.

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:55.152
Thank you.

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:01.657
Thank you.
Good evening.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:05.328
A thousand years ago, a small,
wealthy village in China...

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:08.914
hired a young dragon
to guard their treasures in a cave.

01:01:09.081 --> 01:01:12.834
The people of the village
started sneaking him extra food...

01:01:13.001 --> 01:01:14.961
hoping to make him stronger.

01:01:15.128 --> 01:01:17.463
The dragon grew so big
he got stuck...

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:20.841
and the treasure
was trapped behind him...

01:01:21.008 --> 01:01:22.842
for all eternity.

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:27.388
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have found that lost treasure.

01:01:27.556 --> 01:01:32.810
It is here, inside
the greatest casino in the world!

01:01:32.977 --> 01:01:35.020
Welcome to the Red Dragon...

01:01:35.188 --> 01:01:37.440
where everybody is a winner!

01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:00.668
Black, 29.

01:02:06.299 --> 01:02:09.385
Look at this place, Lee.
It's the biggest front in the world.

01:02:09.552 --> 01:02:11.095
Yeah, right...

01:02:12.971 --> 01:02:15.181
- Would you like a drink?
- Cigarettes?

01:02:18.518 --> 01:02:21.270
- Put your arms around me.
- What?

01:02:21.395 --> 01:02:23.438
Hold me close.
There are cameras everywhere.

01:02:24.899 --> 01:02:27.901
- What's going on?
- I think I may be in trouble, Lee.

01:02:28.068 --> 01:02:30.028
I really need your help.

01:02:30.153 --> 01:02:33.155
Last time you needed my help,
I woke up in a truck.

01:02:33.323 --> 01:02:37.076
I'm undercover, Lee. I had no choice.
You have to trust me.

01:02:37.243 --> 01:02:40.412
Look over my right shoulder.
That's the soft count room.

01:02:40.579 --> 01:02:42.956
We think the plates are in there.

01:02:43.123 --> 01:02:46.083
- I need you to go and get them.
- Why don't you go get them?

01:02:46.209 --> 01:02:50.045
Because if I'm wrong, then my entire
cover is blown. You understand?

01:02:52.006 --> 01:02:54.299
How do I know I can trust you?

01:02:54.425 --> 01:02:55.884
Dip me.

01:02:58.345 --> 01:03:00.805
I'm asking for real now.

01:03:00.972 --> 01:03:03.098
Will you help the Secret Service?

01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:17.862
What are you doing?
Thank you, man. Take this.

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:21.198
- Dancing.
- Dancing?

01:03:21.324 --> 01:03:23.617
Man, I'm up here working,
putting my life on the line...

01:03:23.742 --> 01:03:26.702
and you're up here,
dancing with some bimbo?

01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:29.372
- Does she have a friend?
- That was Isabella.

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:32.082
She says the plates are
in the soft count room.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.960
I know you didn't just say Isabella.
Are you crazy, man?

01:03:35.086 --> 01:03:38.005
- That girl is setting you up again.
- No. I'm gonna find out.

01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:40.048
No, wait, man.

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:44.802
There's security all over. If you're
gonna do this, you need a distraction.

01:03:44.928 --> 01:03:48.347
So keep your eye on me, and you'll
know when to make your move.

01:03:48.473 --> 01:03:49.557
- Good.
- Cool.

01:03:57.272 --> 01:04:00.316
- Come on, big eight!
- Come on, Tex!

01:04:02.819 --> 01:04:04.820
Hey, hey, hey!
Good roll, man!

01:04:04.946 --> 01:04:08.574
This table's hot! I want some
of this money. Get me in this game.

01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:16.581
Let me have a Diet Pepsi
and some hot wings.

01:04:16.706 --> 01:04:19.416
- 100,000. Give him the chips.
- Let's play! I'm gonna get some!

01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:22.127
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this?

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:29.508
No, sir. I did not.
I just assumed that...

01:04:33.012 --> 01:04:36.264
- Is that it?
- No, I didn't think that at all, sir.

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:38.308
- You a racist?
- No, I'm not, sir.

01:04:42.896 --> 01:04:45.148
- How did that happen?
- It just happened. I'm sorry.

01:04:45.273 --> 01:04:49.485
This is crazy. You think my people
suffered 362 years of slavery...

01:04:52.863 --> 01:04:54.656
Do I look like Chicken George to you?

01:04:54.782 --> 01:04:56.742
- You do not.
- What the hell is that?

01:04:56.867 --> 01:05:00.370
- I think you should calm down.
- I think you should go count something.

01:05:02.914 --> 01:05:05.499
Hurry up. I just want to be treated
fairly. Is that too much to ask?

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:08.877
- No.
- Is that too much to ask?

01:05:09.003 --> 01:05:10.546
I got a problem on table nine.

01:05:19.345 --> 01:05:22.681
Why are no black people performing
in this hotel? We ain't good enough?

01:05:22.807 --> 01:05:24.850
We got Lionel Richie
performing here tonight.

01:05:24.975 --> 01:05:27.143
Lionel Richie ain't been black
since the Commodores, man.

01:05:27.269 --> 01:05:29.938
What about Peaches and Herb?
Gladys Knight and the Pips?

01:05:30.063 --> 01:05:33.732
Ike and Tina? They can get
back together. This is crazy.

01:05:33.858 --> 01:05:36.610
Sir, why don't you calm down,
win some money and have some fun?

01:05:36.736 --> 01:05:39.571
I ain't calmin' down no more!
I'm sick of you tryin' to calm me down.

01:05:39.697 --> 01:05:42.491
We got a problem.
Go.

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.090
I have a dream...

01:06:01.216 --> 01:06:04.260
that white people
and black people...

01:06:04.385 --> 01:06:07.429
and even Chinese people
can gamble together...

01:06:07.555 --> 01:06:09.431
without gettin' different chips!

01:06:09.556 --> 01:06:11.349
Hallelujah!

01:06:15.687 --> 01:06:19.398
Hold it. In the spirit of brotherhood,
let's just play craps, man.

01:06:19.524 --> 01:06:21.400
Come on. Let's go.
Come on!

01:06:42.753 --> 01:06:44.212
Oh, shit.

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:30.336
Get him! Stop!

01:08:08.370 --> 01:08:10.997
Inspector Lee, this is a
ying-tao grenade.

01:08:11.623 --> 01:08:12.874
Please follow me.

01:08:14.042 --> 01:08:15.835
Or I'll push this detonator,

01:08:16.169 --> 01:08:18.879
and blow your 32 teeth
into your brain.

01:08:22.049 --> 01:08:23.133
Winner.

01:08:23.259 --> 01:08:26.303
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

01:08:26.428 --> 01:08:29.514
I feel good.
Who put their hand on my butt?

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:31.807
Do it again. Give me that.
How much I win?

01:08:31.933 --> 01:08:33.809
200,000, sir.

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:38.688
All right.

01:08:39.523 --> 01:08:41.274
This seven I'm about to roll...

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.569
is for the 27 years Mandela spent in
that prison and couldn't get justice...

01:08:44.694 --> 01:08:45.945
and took all that crap.

01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:50.490
That's why I ain't gonna crap out.
This one is for Mandela!

01:08:52.743 --> 01:08:53.952
A winner. Seven.

01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:14.554
Out.

01:09:17.932 --> 01:09:22.477
Imagine a business
where people hand you money...

01:09:22.603 --> 01:09:27.065
and you hand them back
absolutely nothing.

01:09:28.942 --> 01:09:32.778
Now, that's
the real American dream.

01:09:32.904 --> 01:09:34.947
Thanks to a few pieces of metal...

01:09:35.072 --> 01:09:39.117
and a most beautiful
U.S. Customs agent...

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:41.536
I'm back in business.

01:09:47.458 --> 01:09:49.418
Look at you, Lee.

01:09:49.543 --> 01:09:51.419
You look ridiculous.

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:57.509
You know it didn't have
to be like this.

01:09:57.634 --> 01:09:59.886
It's too bad.

01:10:00.011 --> 01:10:02.805
Like father, like son.

01:10:04.599 --> 01:10:06.475
He's headed for the penthouse.

01:10:09.478 --> 01:10:11.604
Look at this old fool.

01:10:13.565 --> 01:10:16.275
What does he think he's doing?

01:10:16.401 --> 01:10:19.278
I tell you, it's almost impossible
to find a partner...

01:10:19.403 --> 01:10:22.155
that is trustworthy and loyal.

01:10:22.281 --> 01:10:25.575
Don't you agree, Lee?

01:10:25.701 --> 01:10:28.995
Everything stays on the table.
Don't nobody touch it. You understand?

01:10:32.832 --> 01:10:34.291
Winner, four high.

01:10:41.256 --> 01:10:43.216
- Yes!
- Come on, sir.

01:10:44.717 --> 01:10:48.887
Tell them to get rid of Lee's friend.

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.473
- Cash me out.
- Sir, get off the table.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.183
Thank you very much.

01:10:56.478 --> 01:11:00.356
The trouble
with partners is, they die.

01:11:01.316 --> 01:11:02.775
As will you.

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:10.907
Have fun.

01:11:20.166 --> 01:11:23.502
After I'm through with you you'll be
begging me to push this button.

01:11:27.255 --> 01:11:31.008
Don't move! U.S. Secret Service!
You're under arrest.

01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:50.359
These gentlemen will escort you
to the cashier.

01:11:50.484 --> 01:11:53.820
Good, 'cause I don't want to get jumped
by these rich white folks. Let's go.

01:12:16.924 --> 01:12:20.093
I appreciate this, fellas.
You never can be too safe.

01:12:31.062 --> 01:12:32.229
What the...

01:12:33.731 --> 01:12:35.691
I'm sorry, man.
Did that hurt?

01:12:35.816 --> 01:12:37.067
Hey, you! Hold it!

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.236
You okay?

01:12:59.212 --> 01:13:01.464
Black man get on a roll,
y'all start trippin'.

01:13:01.589 --> 01:13:03.507
- Y'all get back!
- Calm down!

01:13:05.968 --> 01:13:08.345
Get back! Get back!
Get back!

01:13:12.182 --> 01:13:16.185
- Hey, get down.
- Drop the stick.

01:13:22.691 --> 01:13:25.401
Where you been, Lee?
I been on a roll, man!

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:40.082
What happened to you, man?

01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:42.750
What's that light in your mouth?

01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:44.669
Oh, man, this can't be good.

01:13:59.641 --> 01:14:01.976
Move!
Would you get out of my way?

01:14:15.113 --> 01:14:16.322
What's wrong with you?

01:14:16.447 --> 01:14:19.157
What happened to you, man?

01:14:42.762 --> 01:14:44.847
Why the hell you didn't
tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?

01:14:44.973 --> 01:14:46.307
- I did!
- No, you didn't!

01:14:46.432 --> 01:14:49.184
- I said "Mmm!"
- What the hell is "Mmm"?

01:14:52.604 --> 01:14:56.148
Ricky Tan's still alive.
We have to get to the penthouse.

01:14:56.274 --> 01:14:57.900
Ricky Tan dead.

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:59.902
What you talking about?

01:15:06.825 --> 01:15:09.368
Lee. Go after Ricky, man.
I got this.

01:15:09.494 --> 01:15:12.371
- Carter...
- Just go, man. I got this.

01:15:16.876 --> 01:15:19.294
I'm not gonna hold back on you
this time just because you're a woman.

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:23.089
I'm gonna pretend you're a man.

01:15:23.215 --> 01:15:25.967
A very beautiful man
with a perfect body...

01:15:26.092 --> 01:15:28.052
who I'd like to take
to the movies.

01:15:37.311 --> 01:15:39.729
You don't know nothing about this,
do you? Egyptian style, girl.

01:15:39.855 --> 01:15:43.316
You want some of this?
Come on.

01:15:43.441 --> 01:15:44.900
Bring it on!

01:15:56.578 --> 01:15:58.246
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:15:58.371 --> 01:15:59.330
You need help.

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:04.334
I didn't know
which side you were on.

01:16:05.836 --> 01:16:07.629
Well, now you know.

01:16:07.754 --> 01:16:08.963
What's wrong with you, woman?

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.637
Mmm, you smell good.

01:17:13.771 --> 01:17:16.857
Thank you, Benjamin.
Thank you.

01:17:21.111 --> 01:17:25.072
We could have been a good couple.
We could have had something special.

01:17:25.198 --> 01:17:28.075
But you one crazy-ass bitch!

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.963
Americans love to gamble,
don't they, Mr. Reign?

01:17:42.088 --> 01:17:44.214
I never gamble.

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.883
Oh, I'm cutting our deal short.

01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:52.222
And my plates?

01:17:52.347 --> 01:17:55.182
The plates stay with me. I'm sure
you won't have a problem with that.

01:17:57.769 --> 01:17:59.854
I enjoyed that little
story you told...

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:02.439
about the dragon
and the treasure.

01:18:02.565 --> 01:18:05.192
My mother used to tell it
to me all the time.

01:18:06.902 --> 01:18:09.320
Do you know the moral
of that story?

01:18:09.446 --> 01:18:11.781
Greed will imprison us all.

01:18:16.118 --> 01:18:18.620
I hate that fortune-cookie shit.

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:34.592
Just like your father.

01:18:36.803 --> 01:18:39.013
I really did try
to help him, you know.

01:18:39.139 --> 01:18:41.057
To share with him.

01:18:41.182 --> 01:18:43.684
To make your life better.

01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:45.978
But he was too weak.

01:18:46.103 --> 01:18:49.898
- Too afraid of change.
- Give me the plates.

01:18:50.024 --> 01:18:53.527
- It's over.
- I don't think it's over.

01:18:53.652 --> 01:18:57.447
There are casinos
all over this country.

01:18:57.572 --> 01:19:00.491
I can make you
a very rich man, Lee.

01:19:00.616 --> 01:19:03.034
Don't make the same mistake
your father did.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.538
If you reach for that gun,
I'll kill you.

01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:10.916
Don't you remember?
I'm already dead.

01:19:16.672 --> 01:19:18.256
Hey, Ricky.
How you doin'?

01:19:18.382 --> 01:19:20.634
Lee, I see you got
everything under control.

01:19:20.759 --> 01:19:23.761
I'm gonna go downstairs and...
Goddamn!

01:19:23.887 --> 01:19:27.515
- What happened to Reign?
- Shall I tell you how your father died?

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.392
Hey, hey.
Wait one second, Lee.

01:19:30.518 --> 01:19:32.436
It ain't worth it, man.
He tryin' to trick you.

01:19:32.561 --> 01:19:35.188
- Don't go too far, now.
- He never begged for his life...

01:19:35.314 --> 01:19:37.566
- or tried to make a deal.
- Put the gun down.

01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:41.235
All he asked me, just seconds
before I pulled the trigger...

01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:44.155
was that I promise
not to kill you.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:47.449
Oh, he was so pathetic.

01:19:47.575 --> 01:19:51.203
Oh, hell, no. He went too far.
Shoot his ass right now, Lee!

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:52.537
What are you gonna do?

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:55.248
All you got to do is pull
that trigger back and bam!

01:19:55.373 --> 01:19:58.375
Are you going to spend the rest
of your life hiding like your father?

01:19:58.501 --> 01:20:01.086
Man, don't let him talk about
your daddy like that. Shoot him, Lee.

01:20:01.212 --> 01:20:03.547
- You can't do it, can you?
- Yes, hell, you can, Lee.

01:20:03.672 --> 01:20:06.299
- Ain't nobody up here but us.
- Just as I thought.

01:20:06.425 --> 01:20:08.051
He tryin' to punk you.
Shoot him!

01:20:08.176 --> 01:20:11.178
If you ain't gonna shoot him,
kung fu his ass or something.

01:20:33.073 --> 01:20:36.033
Damn!
Good kick, Lee.

01:20:36.201 --> 01:20:38.119
It was an accident.

01:20:38.286 --> 01:20:41.538
That's okay. We'll just say
he tried to catch a cab.

01:20:45.209 --> 01:20:47.294
What's that in your...
Oh, hell, no.

01:20:47.461 --> 01:20:49.879
Lady, you listen
to me right now.

01:20:50.047 --> 01:20:52.966
- Put that bomb down and turn it off!
- Carter, we have to jump!

01:20:53.091 --> 01:20:54.884
You crazy. I ain't jumpin'.

01:20:55.885 --> 01:20:57.970
- Use your jacket!
- Hey, turn that bomb off!

01:20:58.805 --> 01:21:01.098
Crazy-ass...

01:21:15.319 --> 01:21:16.695
That wasn't so bad.

01:21:54.437 --> 01:21:57.523
I cannot believe I flew
10,000 miles for this shit.

01:22:09.534 --> 01:22:11.243
Detective Lee,
I hate to admit it...

01:22:11.369 --> 01:22:14.872
but the United States Secret Service
is indebted to you.

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:17.123
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:22:17.291 --> 01:22:19.167
I'll see you on board.

01:22:22.004 --> 01:22:23.880
I want to thank you too.

01:22:31.762 --> 01:22:34.597
It was nice working with you.

01:22:45.316 --> 01:22:47.609
I saw that.

01:22:47.735 --> 01:22:50.821
You sly devil, you.
She kissed you, didn't she?

01:22:52.489 --> 01:22:55.241
You played it cool, too, walking away
and not looking back. I like that.

01:22:55.366 --> 01:22:57.200
Yeah.
I'm a player.

01:22:59.036 --> 01:23:01.705
- Where is she headed?
- She's going to New York.

01:23:04.041 --> 01:23:07.877
- Is that your gate down there?
- Yep.

01:23:08.003 --> 01:23:10.463
Well, I'm this way.

01:23:10.588 --> 01:23:12.923
- Guess that means good-bye.
- I guess so.

01:23:14.383 --> 01:23:16.259
Thank you, Carter.

01:23:16.385 --> 01:23:18.428
Take good care
of yourself, Lee.

01:23:22.724 --> 01:23:25.226
- Oh, Carter.
- Yeah, Lee?

01:23:25.351 --> 01:23:27.519
What's up?

01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:30.772
There is something
I want you to have.

01:23:33.233 --> 01:23:35.818
No. This is your daddy's badge.
I can't take that, man. No way.

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:38.529
It's okay. No.
Finally, I can let it go.

01:23:40.573 --> 01:23:42.449
Thank you, man.
Hey.

01:23:42.575 --> 01:23:45.786
You know what?
I got something for you too.

01:23:49.915 --> 01:23:52.667
I got it at the tables this morning
at Caesar's. I'm still hot.

01:23:52.793 --> 01:23:56.254
- I can't take this.
- Don't worry. I got a lot more.

01:23:56.379 --> 01:23:59.423
- Go ahead. Enjoy yourself.
- No, Carter. I can't have this.

01:23:59.549 --> 01:24:01.967
Would you stop acting like a cop
for one second and live it up?

01:24:02.092 --> 01:24:04.510
There got to be something
you want. Come on.

01:24:04.636 --> 01:24:06.637
Think about it.

01:24:06.763 --> 01:24:11.558
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 44 to La Guardia.

01:24:11.684 --> 01:24:15.645
I always wanted to go to Madison
Square Garden, see the Knicks play.

01:24:15.771 --> 01:24:17.939
- New York City?
- First class.

01:24:18.065 --> 01:24:20.442
- The Plaza Hotel?
- Maybe a little mu shu?

01:24:20.567 --> 01:24:23.194
- Amen to that, brother.
- So, what do you say?

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.114
You know what, man?
I can use another vacation.

01:24:40.543 --> 01:24:42.211
- Action!
- Let's go!

01:25:08.985 --> 01:25:11.028
- You all right?
- Is he okay?

01:25:11.154 --> 01:25:14.698
- Jackie, you okay?
- Jackie always okay.

01:25:14.824 --> 01:25:18.160
- Is this the kosher meal?
- Yes, sir. That's our kosher meal.

01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:20.662
- What's the name of it?
- Gefilte.

01:25:20.787 --> 01:25:23.414
- Gefilte fish.
- "Filk" fish.

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:26.292
Lox and bagels.
It's my favorite.

01:25:26.417 --> 01:25:28.627
- What's the name of this stuff?
- Gefilte fish.

01:25:30.337 --> 01:25:32.505
"Gefilke" fish...
What's the name of this fish?

01:25:35.676 --> 01:25:38.094
You know what this is?
What is it?

01:25:38.219 --> 01:25:40.554
- Gefilte fish.
- It's "filte" fish.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.473
"Filte" fish. You want some
of my "filte" fish?

01:25:42.598 --> 01:25:45.350
You want any of this...
What's the name of the fish?

01:25:48.896 --> 01:25:50.439
Gefilte fish!
All right. Okay.

01:25:50.564 --> 01:25:53.107
- Gefilte fish. I love this stuff.
- I really don't.

01:25:53.233 --> 01:25:55.526
You have black people
all over the world eatin' this.

01:25:55.652 --> 01:25:59.363
Who eats lox and bagels?
I'll have some "gilte" fish.

01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:15.711
Lady!
Jackie, kick it.

01:26:15.836 --> 01:26:18.171
Okay.
Chris Tucker!

01:26:18.297 --> 01:26:22.050
- Jackie, kick it.
- Jackie again?

01:26:22.175 --> 01:26:24.552
We'd love to see that.
Wouldn't we love to see that, Jackie?

01:26:24.677 --> 01:26:27.304
Jackie, we'd like to see that.

01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:29.515
Now, Jackie,
wouldn't we love to see that?

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.976
- His name is Lee, goddamn it.
- Lee, we would love to see that.

01:26:33.102 --> 01:26:34.811
We would love to see that,
wouldn't we, Lee?

01:26:34.937 --> 01:26:38.773
- There's gotta be something you want.
- I always want to go to Sw...

01:26:38.898 --> 01:26:41.775
I always want to go to Scra...

01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:45.112
I always dreamed to
"Square Marden."

01:26:45.237 --> 01:26:47.447
I always wanted to...

01:26:49.908 --> 01:26:52.243
Now I'm gone.
Now I'm nervous.

01:26:52.369 --> 01:26:55.913
Every "garden," I'm nervous.
Madison Square Garden.

01:26:56.039 --> 01:26:58.249
I always wanted to go
to this Madison...

01:27:00.584 --> 01:27:02.961
- There are a lot of men chasing us.
- As well there should be.

01:27:03.087 --> 01:27:05.172
'Cause you're a very good-looking man.
If I didn't have a girlfriend...

01:27:05.297 --> 01:27:07.173
I'd take a run at you,
put you in a bubble bath...

01:27:07.299 --> 01:27:10.009
and put some water wings on you
and spank your little bottom.

01:27:10.134 --> 01:27:13.345
But listen.
Here's what we do, guys. Easy, easy.

01:27:13.471 --> 01:27:16.473
Look, you're giggling at me.
I'll take you home and just punish you.

01:27:16.599 --> 01:27:18.684
I need both of you.

01:27:18.809 --> 01:27:22.645
You sly devil, you.
She kissed you, didn't she?

01:27:22.771 --> 01:27:24.814
- Yeah.
- I like that.

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:26.732
Oh. Hold on.

01:27:26.858 --> 01:27:30.736
- Who's calling?
- Hello?

01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:34.030
Hello?
I'm filming, man.

01:27:34.156 --> 01:27:36.616
Call me back at 7:00.
I'm filming.

01:27:36.741 --> 01:27:39.493
I'm looking Jackie Chan
dead in his eye. Call me back.

01:27:39.619 --> 01:27:42.204
- Call me back.
- Are you a professional? We are filming.

01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:45.916
- You turn on your phone?
- No, you can't speak to Jackie Chan.

01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:48.042
No! They want to
speak to you, Jackie.

01:27:48.168 --> 01:27:50.044
- Hello?
- I'm sorry about this.

01:27:50.170 --> 01:27:52.839
We are filming right now!

01:27:52.964 --> 01:27:56.550
You're sorry?
You wasted all our film!

01:27:56.676 --> 01:27:58.844
Call me back later.
7:00.

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:07.769
Damn! He ain't
gonna be in Rush Hour 3.
